# rizzle.chat: a refreshing way to chat

rizzle.chat was made because I wanted to speak your true mind in public settings, privately.

I initially built this project in Golang (which you can find [here](https://github.com/edwardwc/old-chat "here")), but decided to switch it to Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects to try it out! I learned quite a bit from this project and I hope you can use it just like I have used other open source contributers' work in the past! 

### Features
- No history & no logging
- Typing indicators
- Random and fun names (in the format of adjective-animal)
- See all users that are recieving your messages
- 3 different styles to chat in
- Fast! (Messages deliver as fast as 20ms)
- Looks beautiful on all platforms!

### Want to see something else? Do you have any questions
I'd love for you to open an issue!

#### Todo
- Encryption
- Private (invite-only) rooms
